# Color Palette Creator Tool

The Color Palette Creator Tool is a Python-based application that extracts dominant colors from images and generates detailed color palettes with variations in brightness and hue. Useful for color analysis, design projects, and creative inspiration.

## Features
- Extract dominant colors from images.
- Generate brightness and hue variations.
- Save color palettes as PNG files.
- Easy-to-use graphical user interface.

Available Executable
An executable version of the Color Palette Creator Tool is available in the releases section. You can download and run the .exe without needing to install Python or dependencies. Please note that the .exe is currently not signed, so you may see warnings from your operating system when trying to run it.

I've also started working on macOS and Linux versions of the executable. These are not yet complete but will be available in future releases.

Let me know if you need any other adjustments!

## Important Note
This tool is designed to generate a color palette rather than perform a full picture analysis. For a more detailed color analysis of an image, consider using external tools like [Color Summarizer](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/color-summarizer//).
