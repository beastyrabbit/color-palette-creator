# Color Palette Creator Tool

The Color Palette Creator Tool is a Python-based application that extracts dominant colors from images and generates detailed color palettes with variations in brightness and hue. Useful for color analysis, design projects, and creative inspiration.

## Features
- Extract dominant colors from images.
- Generate brightness and hue variations.
- Save color palettes as PNG files.
- Easy-to-use graphical user interface.

## Available Executable
An executable version of the Color Palette Creator Tool is available in the releases section. You can download and run the `.exe` without needing to install Python or dependencies.
